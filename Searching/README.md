## Searching Algorithms

Searching Algorithms are used to determine whether a specific piece of data exists within a data structure. Efficiently searching data in complex data structures is one of the most important functionalities.

Here are some of the algorithms used for searching:

* Linear search
* Binary search
* Interpolation search
